TODO: 
* translate tests
* make them pass
* documentation
* syntax sugar
* go over Array and Enumerable to see what additional methods should have a reactive counterpart
* 100+ bloody Rx observable functions one can implement
* proper scheduler support, allow to use Rufus, EM or virtual
* prepare some kickass samples
